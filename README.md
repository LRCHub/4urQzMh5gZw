Realest shit I wrote
(Doin' life)
Realest shit I wrote
(We doin' life, nigga)
Realest shit I wrote
This be the realest shit I wrote
Realest shit I wrote
Realest shit I wrote
Be the realest shit I wrote
(Doin' life), yeah
For all my niggas doin' life
with they day one
Who held it down
when the credit wasn't A1?
You thankin' God,
you was lookin' for a great one
He took a rib out your chest
and He made one
To be a man and hold it down,
take a brave one
When the hoes come around
and you crave somethin'
My flow switch,
slow the pace, this the Ma$e one
I'm not a player
but I'm crushin' like the late Pun
Let's take one, go
The definition of rider
The one by my side
when I had not a dollar to my name
Before a crowd would holler
for Jermaine,
you saw potential
Waitin' on you to hit
my line was suspenseful
Back when we was kids,
this was simple
Boy likes girl,
girl got a man
Boy stays in lane,
maybe provides a friend
Knowin' by the end buddy gon' fumble
Was far from the toughest around,
buddy gon' rumble
When necessary,
when niggas started talkin' reckless
Did he not step to them niggas
with chest poked out?
Over you, that 'Ville come out,
no doubt
We fell in love,
but my dreams you ain't know 'bout
You knew I rap, but, you ain't know
'bout both of my goals
Wanna take over the globe through a mic'
And one day me and you be doin' life
All types of games are being played,
how's it goin' down? (Yeah)
It's on 'til it's gone
and I gots to know now (Yeah)
Is you with me or what?
A nigga really think he in love (Uh-huh)
I put this ring on you forever,
what's up?
All types of games are being played,
how's it goin' down? (Yeah)
It's on 'til it's gone
and I gots to know now (Yeah)

A nigga really think he in love (Uh-huh)
I put this ring on you forever,
what's up? (We doin' life)
Uh, the puppy love had grown
and now it's full blown
Since childhood,
I vowed to have a good home
White picket fence with wife cookin'
Yellow rice for a couple kids
that's nice lookin'
And I promise to treat her right
Unlike what I had seen
in my life as examples,
marriages in shambles
And I can tell I found a real one
Smart, loyal, and real pretty,
we can build somethin'
But first, I got work to do
So, when I'm spendin' my nights
locked in on that mic',
please, don't take it personal
My skills is growin',
the flows more versatile
My name's ringin' and on the evenin',
I heard the news
I'm gettin' a deal,
the first one I called was you
Even though we been off-and-on
a few years
And through tears on rainy nights
that you would wipe
I always knew that we'd be doin' life
All types of games are being played,
how's it goin' down? (Yeah)
It's on 'til it's gone
and I gots to know now (Yeah)
Is you with me or what?
A nigga really think he in love (Uh-huh)
I put this ring on you forever,
what's up?

The temptation of other lovers
is a hard one
To overcome when you're young
and your star's done align
Now women that wouldn't give you
time is callin' you fine
Lust creeps all through your mind,
I'm tryin' my hardest
To remember why I'm an artist
Is it for bitches and the riches?
You all suspicious,
and you should be
I'm doin' dirt,
but it's not as much as I could be
That make me feel better
I'm driftin' away slowly,
that make you feel bitter
The Devil on my shoulder
tellin' me, "Quit her"
Angel on the opposite side sayin,
"Stick with her"
God tellin' me pick
whichever is in my heart
Looked inside myself to a place
beyond thought
And found out who I want to be
Slowly, but surely he cut off his hoes
If you gon' do it, do it right
Put ring on your finger,
now, me and you is doin' life
All types of games are being played,
how's it goin' down? (Yeah)
It's on 'til it's gone
and I gots to know now (Yeah)
Is you with me or what?
A nigga really think he in love (Uh-huh)
I put this ring on you forever,
what's up?

I done wrote a lot of songs,
but this- this gotta be my realest one
Shoutout to anybody that really know
what it's like to do life with somebody
Through the ups, the downs,
the goods, the bads,
through thick and thin
In a time
where they make it so easy to just
give up
Know what I mean?
