Burn the bridges, bathe in the ash
Gave it all I had, now it’s time to take it back
I feel hollow, an empty shell,
Just a prisoner of myself (just a prisoner of myself)
You can’t see the sun
When your judgement is clouded
Words break silence
But your actions speak louder
No rest for the wicked, behind these cold steel bars
This is my life sentence, guilty as charged
Relentless silence, everlasting conviction
Guilty as charged
Convicted, sentence to serve
Incarceration for this life on Earth
Life sentence
Relentless silence, everlasting conviction
No longer recognise the face in the mirror
Scream into the void but no one’s listening
I’ll take the blame, a product of my own mistakes
Still scratching at the same four walls
Lock me down I will never be tamed
Quick to judge but you don’t know my pain
Foundations crumble, ready for the final outcome
Just a prisoner, just a prisoner
Just a prisoner of myself
Just a prisoner, just a prisoner
I’m just a prisoner of myself
Fuck
