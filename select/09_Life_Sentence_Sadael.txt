Perseverence
Disobedience
Cry for
Destruction

Obsolete as a life sentence
You find what you please
As you have seen
What quite intrigues
How did that part percieve

What does deceive your mind
Get rid of parts
With lost memories

Now it's your time
Your last defeat
What was left to rot

All is decayed
Past thought denied
Earthly blight goodbye

Will and power
Engulfed in decay
I'm locked up tight
Take your waste
Just go away

Perseverence
Disobedience
Cry for
Destruction

You cannot keep inside
What once was sweet
Turns sour
Deceit
