Stop
Let your words fly out
Before your heart drops
And before your mouth
Filters all your thoughts
Just say what you mean
I promise it won't hurt me
I'm strong, can't you see?
Only broken down seven times this week

Maybe we can start again
But that may be a lie
And for lies I'm guilty
Maybe we can just pretend
That all these high hopes will never kill me

So kiss me one more time
And trust me this is fine
Insanity's a sin
And there's no repentance
Go on and kiss mе one more time
I assurе you this is fine
Insanity's a crime
And I have a life sentence

Stop
Let your words fly free
And don't let your blood clot
And that's because of me
Hey, don't you know
There's poison in these shots
But I'm not a vaccine
But you are it to me though
I'm just a pill, can't you see?
Just a worthless placebo

Maybe we can start again
But that may be a lie
And for lies I'm guilty
Maybe we can just pretend
That all these high hopes will never kill me

So kiss me one more time
Trust me this is fine
Insanity's a sin
And there's no repentance
(Hey, yeah)
Go on and kiss me one more time
Trust me this is fine
Insanity's a crime
And I have a life sentence

Oh, this illusion causes confusion
No clarity at all
Please have some patience
With these fabrications
Don't soften your
All this solution causes confusion
No clarity at all
Please have some patience
With these fabrications
Don't soften your

Maybe we can start again
All this illusion causes confusion
No clarity at all
Maybe we can just pretend
Please have some patience
With these fabrications

Go on and just kiss me one more time
Trust me this is fine
You know insanity's a sin
And there's no repentance
Yeah
Go on and just kiss me one more time
Trust me this is fine
Insanity's a crime
And I have a life sentence
